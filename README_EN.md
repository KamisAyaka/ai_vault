- ü§ñ **AI Agent Control**: AI agents automatically manage investment strategies and asset allocation
- üîÑ **Multi-protocol Support**: Integrates mainstream DeFi protocols like Aave, Uniswap V2/V3
- üíé **ETH Support**: Direct deposit and conversion support for ETH and WETH
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security Assurance**: Reentrancy attack protection, access control, and parameter validation
- üìä **Real-time Monitoring**: Complete test suite and integration tests

### Tech Stack

‚öôÔ∏è Built with NextJS, RainbowKit, Foundry, Wagmi, Viem and Typescript

- ‚úÖ **Contract Hot Reload**: Frontend automatically adapts when you edit smart contracts
- ü™ù **[Custom Hooks](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/)**: Collection of React hooks around [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/)
- üß± [**Components**](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/components/): Collection of common web3 components
- üî• **Burner Wallet and Local Faucet**: Quick testing of applications
- üîê **Wallet Provider Integration**: Connect different wallet providers

## System Requirements

Before starting, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v20.18.3)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

## Quick Start

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2 and the AI Vault project, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KamisAyaka/ai_vault.git
cd ai_vault
yarn install
```

### 2. Start Local Network

Run in the first terminal:

```bash
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Foundry. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/foundry/foundry.toml`.

### 3. Deploy AI Vault Contracts

In the second terminal, deploy the AI Vault system:

```bash
# Deploy complete AI Vault system
yarn deploy --file DeployAIVault.s.sol

# Or deploy basic test contracts
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys the AI Vault smart contracts to the local network. The contracts are located in `packages/foundry/contracts` and can be modified as needed. The `yarn deploy` command uses deployment scripts located in `packages/foundry/script` to deploy contracts to the network.

### 4. Start Frontend Application

In the third terminal, start your NextJS application:

```bash
yarn start
```


Visit your application: `http://localhost:3000`. You can use the `Debug Contracts` page to interact with your smart contracts. You can adjust application configuration in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.
