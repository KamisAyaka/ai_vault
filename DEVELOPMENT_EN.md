## üîÑ AI Vault Workflow

1. **Vault Creation**: AI manager configures protocol and adds vault contracts through AIAgentVaultManager
2. **Adapter Configuration**: AI manager configures protocol adapter parameters through AIAgentVaultManager
3. **Strategy Development**: AI manager develops investment strategies through AIAgentVaultManager
4. **Strategy Execution**: AIAgentVaultManager calls VaultShares to execute investment strategies
5. **Fund Allocation**: VaultShares allocates funds to different DeFi protocols through protocol adapters
6. **Yield Generation**: Each protocol generates returns and returns them to VaultShares
7. **Yield Distribution**: VaultShares distributes returns to share holders

```

## üìú Deployment and Script Execution

The project includes multiple deployment and test scripts located in the `packages/foundry/script/` directory.

### Available Scripts

#### 1. Deploy.s.sol - Complete Deployment Script

Deploy all core contracts (including VaultShares, adapters, etc.):

```bash
yarn deploy
```

#### 2. SimulateTrading.s.sol - Trading Simulation Script

Simulates the complete trading flow of the vault, including real trading behaviors of 4 different types of users:

**Feature Description:**

This script simulates 4 different types of users:

- **Admin (Administrator)**: System administrator with mixed investment strategy
- **User1 (Conservative Investor)**: Large stablecoin investment, long-term holding (7 days), minimal redemption
- **User2 (ETH Investor)**: Focused on ETH investment, medium risk, partial redemption and additional deposits
- **User3 (Active Trader)**: Diversified investment, frequent trading, portfolio rebalancing

**Execution Method:**

Run on local chain:

```bash
# 1. Start local chain
yarn chain

# 2. Deploy contracts in new terminal
yarn deploy

# 3. Execute simulation trading script in third terminal, enter foundry folder
forge script script/SimulateTrading.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```

Run on testnet:

```bash
forge script script/SimulateTrading.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```

**Script Execution Flow:**

1. Connect to deployed contracts (VaultManager, vaults, adapters, etc.)
2. Allocate tokens and ETH to 4 test accounts
3. Execute trading operations for each user:
   - Admin: Deposit 20,000 USDC, 15,000 USDT, 50 ETH, redeem 1/20 after 1 day
   - User1: Deposit 50,000 USDC, 30,000 USDT, redeem only 1/50 after 7 days
   - User2: Deposit 25 ETH, redeem 1/5 after 3 days, then deposit 5 ETH
   - User3: Deposit 15,000 USDC, 10,000 USDT, frequent trading and rebalancing
4. Output final balances and shares for all accounts

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**:

- The script uses fixed test account private keys, only for development testing
- If contracts are redeployed, contract addresses need to be updated in the script (`_getDeployedAddresses()` method)
- After execution, transaction data can be viewed through The Graph or console output

#### 4. VerifyAll.s.sol - Contract Verification Script

Verify deployed contracts on block explorer:

```bash
yarn verify
```

### Deploy to Different Networks

**Local Network (Anvil):**

```bash
# Start local chain
yarn chain

# Deploy in new terminal
yarn deploy
```

**Testnet (e.g., Sepolia):**

```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url sepolia --broadcast --verify
```

**Mainnet:**

```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url mainnet --broadcast --verify
```

## üöÄ Setting Up The Graph Integration

Now that we have started the blockchain, started the frontend application and deployed the smart contracts, we can begin setting up our subgraph and leveraging The Graph!

> Before following these steps, make sure Docker is running!

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Clean Old Data and Start Docker Containers

First run the following command to clean any old data. If you need to reset everything, please do so.

```bash
yarn subgraph:clean-node
```

> Now we can start a graph node by running the following command... üßë‚ÄçüöÄ

```bash
yarn subgraph:run-node
```

This will start all containers for The Graph using docker-compose. You need to keep this window open at all times so you can see the Docker log output.

> As mentioned before, please make sure to keep this window open at all times so you can see any log output from Docker. üîé

> Note: If you run Linux, you need to make some additional changes to the project.

#### Linux Only

**For hardhat**

Update your hardhat chain in package.json in packages/hardhat with the following command line options.

```json
"chain": "hardhat node --network hardhat --no-deploy --hostname 0.0.0.0"
```

**For foundry**

Update your anvil chain in package.json in packages/foundry with the following command line options.

```json
"chain": "anvil --host 0.0.0.0 --config-out localhost.json"
```

Save the file, then restart your chain in its original window.

```bash
yarn chain
```

Redeploy your smart contracts.

```bash
yarn deploy
```

You may also need to add a firewall exception for port 8432. For Ubuntu... run the following command.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8545/tcp
```

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Create and Deploy Our Subgraph

Now we can open a fifth window to complete The Graph setup. üòÖ In this fifth window, we will create our local subgraph!

> Note: You only need to do this once.

```bash
yarn subgraph:create-local
```

> You should see some output stating that your subgraph has been created, along with log output from the graph-node inside docker.

Next we will deploy our subgraph! After executing this command, you need to give the subgraph a version. (e.g. 0.0.1).

```bash
yarn subgraph:local-ship
```

> This command does all of the following in one go... üöÄüöÄüöÄ

- Copy contract ABI from hardhat/deployments folder
- Generate networks.json file
- Generate AssemblyScript types from subgraph schema and contract ABI
- Compile and check mapping functions
- ...and deploy the local subgraph!

> If you encounter ts-node errors, you can install it using the following command

```bash
npm install -g ts-node
```

You should get build completion output along with the subgraph endpoint address.

```
Build completed: QmYdGWsVSUYTd1dJnqn84kJkDggc2GD9RZWK5xLVEMB9iP

Deployed to http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/scaffold-eth/your-contract/graphql

Subgraph endpoints:
Queries (HTTP):     http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/scaffold-eth/your-contract
```

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Test Your Subgraph

Continue to your subgraph endpoint to check it out!

> Here's an example query...

```graphql
{
  greetings(first: 25, orderBy: createdAt, orderDirection: desc) {
    id
    greeting
    premium
    value
    createdAt
    sender {
      address
      greetingCount
    }
  }
}
```

> If everything is working correctly and you have sent transactions to the smart contract, then you will see similar data output!

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Create Graph Client Artifacts

Graph Client is a tool for querying GraphQL-based applications, containing many advanced features such as client composition or automatic pagination. The complete feature list and goals for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-client?tab=readme-ov-file#features-and-goals).

To use Graph-Client in our application, we need to build the artifacts required by the frontend. To do this, just run...

```bash
yarn graphclient:build
```

After completion, navigate to http://localhost:3000/subgraph, and you should be able to see GraphQL rendered in your application. If you can't see anything, make sure you have triggered events in the smart contract.

If you want to see this query code, you can find the component in the subgraph folder `packages/nextjs/app/subgraph/_components/GreetingsTable.tsx`.

### ‚úÖ Side Quest: Run Matchstick Tests

Matchstick is a [unit testing framework](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/unit-testing-framework/) developed by [LimeChain](https://limechain.tech/) that enables subgraph developers to test their mapping logic in a sandbox environment and confidently deploy their subgraphs!

The project includes a pre-written test in `packages/subgraph/tests/asserts.test.ts`

To test, just enter...

```bash
yarn subgraph:test
```

> This will run `graph test` and automatically download the files needed for testing.

You should receive the following output.

```

```

> Note: If you encounter errors, you can try passing the `-d` flag `yarn subgraph:test -d`. This will run matchstick in the docker container.

## üöÄ Deploy to Subgraph Studio

> Note: This step requires deploying contracts to a live network. Check the supported [network list](https://thegraph.com/docs/networks).

1. Update the `packages/subgraph/subgraph.yaml` file with your contract address, network name, start block number (optional):

   ```diff
   ...
   -     network: localhost
   +     network: sepolia
         source:
           abi: YourContract
   +       address: "0x54FE7f8Db97e102D3b7d86cc34D885B735E31E8e"
   +       startBlock: 5889410
   ...
   ```

   Tip: For `startBlock`, you can use the block number of the deployed contract, which can be found by visiting the deployed transaction hash in the block explorer.

2. Create a new subgraph on [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio) and get the "SUBGRAPH SLUG" and "DEPLOY KEY".

3. Authenticate using graph CLI:

   ```sh
   yarn graph auth --studio <DEPLOY KEY>
   ```

4. Deploy the subgraph to TheGraph Studio:

   ```sh
   yarn graph deploy --studio <SUBGRAPH SLUG>
   ```

   After deployment, the CLI should output the subgraph endpoint. Copy the HTTP endpoint and test your queries.

5. Update `packages/nextjs/components/ScaffoldEthAppWithProviders.tsx` to use the above HTTP subgraph endpoint:
   ```diff
   - const subgraphUri = "http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/scaffold-eth/your-contract";
   + const subgraphUri = 'YOUR_SUBGRAPH_ENDPOINT';
   ```
